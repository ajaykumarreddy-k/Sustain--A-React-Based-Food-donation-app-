# Sustain - Community Donation & Sustainability Platform

## Project Overview
"Sustain" is a mobile-first web application designed to foster community sustainability through peer-to-peer donations. The platform connects individuals who have excess resources—specifically food and funds—with those in need or community organizations. By facilitating local sharing, the app aims to reduce food waste and strengthen community bonds.

## Frontend Technology Stack
The application is built using a modern, performance-oriented stack to ensure a responsive and smooth user experience, particularly on mobile devices.

*   **Core Framework:** React 19 (Latest stable release)
*   **Language:** TypeScript (for type safety and improved developer experience)
*   **Build Tool:** Vite (for fast development and optimized production builds)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive UI development)
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion (for complex, smooth layout transitions and interaction feedback)
*   **Icons:** Lucide React (Clean, consistent SVG icons)
*   **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect for local state and theme management)

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Donation Feed
*   **Home Feed:** A scrollable list displaying available donation items in the vicinity.
*   **Item Details:** Each listing includes clear metadata such as title, description, donor information, distance, time remaining, and category (e.g., Produce, Prepared, Bakery).

### 2. Location-Based Discovery
*   **Map View:** An interactive map interface that allows users to visualize donation pickups relative to their current location, making it easier to find nearby resources.

### 3. Dual Donation Streams
The platform supports two distinct flows for contributors:
*   **Food Donation:** A specialized flow for listing edible items, categorized to ensure safety and clarity.
*   **Monetary Support:** A streamlined process for financial contributions to support community initiatives.

### 4. User Dashboard & Activity
*   **Profile Management:** Users can manage their personal information and app preferences.
*   **Activity Tracking:** A dedicated view to monitor past donations, claimed items, and overall impact.

### 5. Modern UI/UX Features
*   **Mobile-First Design:** The layout is optimized for mobile viewports (`max-w-md`), mimicking a native app experience with a bottom navigation bar.
*   **Dark Mode Support:** Fully integrated dark theme that respects system preferences and offers a manual toggle.
*   **Smooth Transitions:** Views transition seamlessly using spring physics (Framer Motion), and critical actions like donating trigger immersive overlays.

1. Technology Stack
A. Frontend (User Interface)

Framework: React.js (v18+) with Vite.

Reasoning: Ensures high-performance rendering and component-based architecture for the modular design of donation cards.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first framework).

Reasoning: Implements the "Glassmorphism" UI and ensures responsive design across all screen sizes.

Animation: Framer Motion.

Reasoning: Provides physics-based spring animations for a premium, native-app feel.

B. Backend & Logic

Core Backend: Python (FastAPI) [Optional: or Node.js via Supabase Edge Functions].

Reasoning: Python is chosen for its robust libraries in handling data processing and potential future integration of custom AI models.

Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase).

Reasoning: A relational database is required to handle complex geospatial queries (e.g., "Find active donations within 5km radius") which NoSQL cannot handle efficiently.

C. Artificial Intelligence (The Core)

Model: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (Vision API).

Reasoning: Utilized for real-time "Image-to-Text" recognition to verify food quality, estimate expiration, and auto-tag categories (e.g., Bakery, Veg).

Integration: REST API with "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) architecture for infinite scalability.

D. Mobile Development (The Bundling)

Wrapper Framework: Ionic Capacitor.

Reasoning: Bridges the web code (React) to native mobile APIs (Camera, Geolocation, Haptics) without rewriting the codebase.

Build Environment: Android Studio (Gradle Build System).

Reasoning: Required to compile the final .apk and .aab (Android App Bundle) files and manage native permission manifests (Camera/Location access).

2. Methodology: Web-to-Mobile Conversion
This section explains exactly "how" you are turning a website into an app, which professors often ask about.

The project utilizes a Hybrid Mobile Architecture. Instead of maintaining two separate codebases (Java for Android, Swift for iOS), we develop a "Progressive Web Application" (PWA) that is encapsulated into a native container.

Development Phase: The core application is built using React.js, running on a local development server (Vite).

Native Bridging: We utilize Capacitor to inject a JavaScript Bridge. This allows the React web code to communicate with the phone's native hardware (e.g., triggering the physical vibration motor or accessing the raw camera stream).

Compilation:

The React project is built into static assets (HTML/CSS/JS).

Android Studio wraps these assets into a native "WebView" Activity.

Gradle compiles this into a standard binary (.apk) installable on any Android device.

3. Architecture Diagram (Text Representation)
If you have space in your abstract, draw a simple block diagram like this:

Plaintext

[ User Camera ]  <-->  [ React UI (Frontend) ]  <-->  [ Capacitor Bridge ]
       |                          |                             |
       v                          v                             v
[ Google Gemini AI ]      [ Supabase DB ]             [ Native Android APIs ]
   (Verification)         (Data Storage)              (Location/Haptics)
Quick Tips for Your Abstract Presentation:
Why Python? If asked, say: "We selected Python for the backend logic because it is the industry standard for AI integration and data analysis."

Why Web-to-App? Say: "This approach allows us to deploy updates to the server instantly without forcing users to re-download the app from the Play Store every time we fix a bug."
